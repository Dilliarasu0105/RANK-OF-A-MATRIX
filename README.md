# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1: 
We have imported numpy which is needed.
### Step 2:
We have created a matrix by using np.array with different values in it.
### Step 3: 
Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.
### Step 4:
Finally, print the value of the rank of the matrix.
## Program:

## Developed by:DILLIARASU M 

## RegisterNumber:212223230049 

import numpy as np

A=np.array([[3,2,5],[1,1,2],[3,3,6]])

rank=np.linalg.matrix_rank(A)

print(rank)
## Output:

## Result:
Thus the rank for the given matrix is successfully solved by  using a python program.
